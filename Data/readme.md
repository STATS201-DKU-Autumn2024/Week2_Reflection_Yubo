## Data Source

The EcoCultural Dataset (ECD) provides a comprehensive collection of country-level data on ecological and cultural variables, covering 220 countries. This dataset is designed to support research on the relationships between ecological conditions (e.g., climate, resource availability) and cultural variation (e.g., social norms, personality traits). The ECD combines data from sources like the World Bank, World Health Organization, and other scholarly publications, providing both historical and recent measurements for various indicators. This rich dataset enables the analysis of ecological impacts on cultural diversity and allows researchers to explore global patterns in cultural behavior influenced by environmental factors.
